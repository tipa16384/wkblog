I was fascinated by UltrViolet's DevOps-ification of his blog, "[Endgame Viable](https://endgameviable.com/dev/2021/08/status-quest-for-the-one-blog-part-13/)". The sort of stuff he's doing is the sort of stuff I do every day at work. I'm getting paid to get better at doing all of this stuff, but my own blog can't take advantage?

That ends today. Today, I bring my old blog, West Karana, back to life, via the magic of DevOps.

DevOps is just a fancy way of bringing every IT position into one person -- the developer.

- We don't need an architect for our code, the developer can do it (lol)- We don't need a QA person for our code, the developer can do it (Cypress and Karate)- We don't need a DBA to manage our databases, the developer can do it (Liquibase)- ...

Jack of all trades, master of none. I present to you the DevOps developer.

Anyway. UltrViolet made a whole new workflow where he creates documents in a text editor marked up in Markdown format, and then has scripts crawl through stuff and do magic and out spits a blog. It's all very magical.

I'm not nearly up to that point. But, I'm sitting on years worth of SQL code that could, in theory, move my old blog, West Karana, to a new place, potentially even this blog. But there's conflicts with newer versions of WordPress, categories, tags, all sorts of cruft. If I could just bring *both* blogs into Python, then I could fix all the inconsistencies and then spit out a new back end that contains both blogs.

First, though, I'd have to start writing code to turn the old SQL backup into something I could work with.

- Open the backup SQL file- For each lineIs this a SQL insert for a new blog post?Use my SQLConsumer action to parse the line into a dictionary of column name: data pairs- Create a new "Post" object with that data- call the "Post" object to write itself to a file in Markdown format
- Is this a SQL insert for a new comment?Worry about this later

So, as a proof of concept, all the text of all the posts (sans images, comments, and meta information) is now backed up, in Markdown format, in GitHub.

Here's [a sample post from the past](https://github.com/tipa16384/westkarana/blob/somethingelse/posts/5144.md):

The link above goes into the actual repo, where, with a little poking around, you can find some of my very dirty, banging together at midnight, code that does the deed.

I don't remember any of this stuff -- especially the DDO stuff. I don't remember Kasul ever playing DDO with me -- and I bet if I asked him, he wouldn't, either. But here it is, in black and white.

Next steps are to get the images loaded. I can put them into GitHub as well, *or* I could copy them into an AWS S3 bucket and then talk to them from there. It would be fun to put them in AWS, but then I might have to pay actual money.

But, for those who've been, for some reason, wanting to look at the old stuff, it's all there, and will only be becoming *more* "there" as time goes on.
