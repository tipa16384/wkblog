They say "Pyroclastic Flow", but it's really Tetris. Rock Tetris. With 100,000,000 pieces. Massive.
<!--more-->

If ever there was a day to write a game for, this one would be it. Because it is Tetris.

[The setup here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17) is you are trying to escape with the elephants from the imminently erupting volcano, and the elephants don't believe you can predict where the rocks falling, one at a time, from an opening far above, so they refuse to run to safety.

Part 1 is to drop 2,022 Tetris piece-shaped rocks and see where they land. Part 2 is to drop a trillion blocks. Not a typo.

Until I saw what Part 2 was, I was just going to solve this in PICO-8 and get a game out of it for free. But Part 2 said that this was not a puzzle about playing Tetris. It was a puzzle about finding a sequence.

The rules of this challenge always drop the same five blocks in the same order, starting in the same position relative to the already placed pieces. Pieces are moved left and right as they drop according to the puzzle input.

At some point, the sequence of dropped blocks will repeat. The trick (there is always a trick) is to find the start and length of this sequence, and then use that plus the bits at the start and end that don't rate a full sequence to find the total height of the column (which for my puzzle was 1,536,231,884,054 units.) If a unit was a meter, the column of rocks would stretch from the Earth to Saturn. So these elephants are a *little* unreasonable.

There are a bunch of cool algorithms to find sequences in data, but my understanding of them is poor, so I just used brute force to find it. And I think, maybe, I found a bug?

Almost everyone solved Part 1 by programming the Tetris game and just seeing how things landed. I did, too, and got the correct answer, and moved on.

Part 2 required this other thing, and I did that, got the correct answer... but didn't move on. Instead, I tried to solve Part 1 with this, since the sequence would be the same (even if it wasn't long enough to contain a full sequence, it would just consist of the beginning part and the end part with no sequence).

And it *almost* worked -- it was off by one.

I just don't get it. I'm not surprised, as it measures to the bottom of the last dropped rock. When I ran the game for Part 1, I added the height of that last rock in for the correct answer. The new solution doesn't do that.

So I really expected Part 2 to be off by one, not Part 1. It does not make any sense at all. 

Anyway, maybe I'll come back and write the PICO-8 version of this.

This is not clean, nor elegant. Just gonna leave it here without comment.
