Turns out the elves just really loved the Atari 2600 so much, they built their little handheld computers around them. And now it's up to us to fix one.
<!--more-->

This is the first puzzle that doesn't feature any elves, just the presumably human protagonist, and so I use a human for today's picture.

Part 1 of [today's puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10) is mostly just getting you ready to solve Part 2. You're trying to write a display driver for the handheld machine they gave you, which was destroyed when you plummeted into the river when the rope bridge broke yesterday.

As the puzzle points out, the old Atari 2600 game system used to make multiple sprites appear while using just one sprite by repositioning the sprite between every scan line. Today's Part 2 does just that -- you interpret a program that moves the sprite (basically a rectangle) every few clock cycles so that when the CRT beam hits it, it lights up the pixel at the correct spot. I have a visualization for that below.

**Python 3.11**

But first, the Python implementation.

I could have saved some space by recognizing that, with only two instructions, I don't need to build a mechanism that can handle any number of commands, but I did, anyway. I'm thinking at some point we'll need to extend this machine at some point, and I might as well prepare. Last year we had a programming thing as the very last day, which of course wasn't extended. But in 2019, a similar scheme was extended throughout all of Advent, and ended with an actual text adventure game at the end :-) I doubt that will happen again, but there's no reason to go for a *little* clarity now and then.

`def run_program(commands):
    command_list = {'noop': (1, lambda x, _: x),
                    'addx': (2, lambda x, y: x + y)}
    x, clock = 1, 1
    program_state = [(0, 0)]

    for command in commands:
        toks = command.split()
        op = toks[0]
        arg = int(toks[1]) if len(toks) == 2 else None
        x = command_list[op][1](x, arg)
        clock += command_list[op][0]
        program_state.append((clock, x))

    return program_state

def state_at(program_state, t):
    for i in range(len(program_state) - 1):
        if program_state[i][0] 

**Java 14**

Someone on Reddit said he admired the lack of encapsulation in my Java solutions. I think he was being sarcastic, as he is a high school teacher who teaches for the Advanced Placement Computer Science (APCS) exam. I guess I opened myself up for that when I asked why he was using such primitive Java in his solutions -- it turns out he was programming to a very minimum subset of Java, just that small portion taught in APCS courses.

As before, and as yesterday, it is similar to the Python solution, and uses inner classes to make up for the lack of tuples in Java.

**The Game**

Well, I didn't write a game today, *per se*, but I did write up a visualization. So if you want to see what the output of Part 2 looks like, here it is. Simply run it.
